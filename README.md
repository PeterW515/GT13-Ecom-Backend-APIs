  ## Installation

  Download the dependencies using the node package manager, create the schema using MySQL, seed the database with the `npm run seed` command, and then interact with the API endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data.

  ---
  
  ## Usage

  Run the `npm start` command to launch the server once the database is seeded. From that point, use an API testing program such as Postman to use the APIs.
